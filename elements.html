									<h2>1. Intelligent agent for Mathematics Tutor</h2>
									<div class="box">
										<h3>BASED ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h3>
										<p>
											Intelligent Tutoring Systems incorporate Artificial Intelligence techniques,in order to imitate a human tutor. These expert systems are able to assess studentâ€™s proficiency, to provide solved examples and exercises for practice in each topic, as well as to provide  immediate and personalized feedback to learners.The primary function of an Intelligent Agent is to help a user (client) to better interact with a computer application.                                           This project simulates the behaviour of instructors and students and the relations between them in  teaching the course Mathematics. In this system the technology of Intelligent Agents is used.
										This consists of 4 modules like<br /> <b> > Question selector module</b> (where student can select the topic which he was intrested to learn.) <br /> <b> > Student Module</b> (Records the history of each constraint. This implies information about satisfaction of the student in particular topic)<br /> <b> > Pedagogic module</b> (mimics the course patterns and educational tactics of a real human tutor.) <br /> <b> > Interface Module</b>
									  <br />The Intelligent Tutoring System work on these 4 modules inorder to complete the task.</p>

									<h2>2. FOOD RATING SYSTEM</h2>
									<div class="box">
										<h3>BASED ON DATA WAREHOUSE AND MINING</h3>
										<p>Food Recipe Rating system that detects hidden  sentiments in feedback of the customer and rates the feedback accordingly. The system uses opinion mining methodology in order to achieve desired functionality.The System takes feedback of various users, based on the opinion, system will specify whether the posted Food is good, bad, or worst. We use a database of sentiment based keywords along with positivity or negativity weight in database and then based on these sentiment keywords mined in user feedback is ranked.System will use database and will match the feedback with the keywords in database and will rank the feedback.The method Multipe linear regression is used to predict the rating of the food.<br />
											PREDICTORS: Calories, Proteins, Fat, Fiber, Sugars, Carbo.<br />
											TARGET: Rating.

									<h2>3. SPORLD COMPANY</h2>
									<div class="box">
										<h3>BASED ON DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING</h3>
										<p>project is implemented by Hive and Hbase. Sporld is a sports company. It sells sports products like bats, balls,sports shoes etc.. Mainly the aim of the company is to sell the products at a reasonable price to the customers. So the company wants to make a database which give sales of a product corresponding to its respective sport by using HIVE OR H-BASE, So created a three databases like SPORTS COMPANY, PRODUCT, WORKSHOP and executed a few aueries on these 3 databases to retrieve certain data.</p>
									</div>
									<h2>4. DOCTOR APPOINTMENT SYSTEM</h2>
									<div class="box">
										<h3>BASED ON JAVA</h3>
										<p>This project provide easy way to patients while taking appointment in hospital. The application needs to provide the details of the slot and doctor available and to search for a free slot on a day-wise , week-wise and also Doctor wise. Consists of 4 modules like: <br /> <b> > REGESTRATION OF PATIENT</b> <br/> <b> > APPOINTMENT SEARCH </b> <br /> <b> > DOCTOR SEARCH </b><br /> <b> > BOOKING APPOINTMNENT</b> <br />
										Maintained a files for the available doctors  and also maintained a files for patients to record their health status and appointment status. Used 3 classes like Patients class, Doctor class, Slots avaialable class and applied OOPS concepts.</p>

									<h2>Internship Project</h2>
									<h3> Head movement controlled Wheel chair</h3>
									
									<p>The objective of this project is to construct a wheelchair which can be directly controlled by the head movement.The method employed in this project is the Brain-computer Interface (BCI), which enables direct communication between the head and the electrical wheelchair.<br />
										Used Arduino for implementation of the project and Emotiv EPOC head set is used inorder to capture the signals.<br />
										some users who completely lost their hands or those who having the difficulty to control their hands such as Poliomyelitis patients are not able to navigate the wheelchair movement. Hence, they are incapable to move around by themselves.
With this intention to resolve this issue, another constructive way is by using the brain to directly control the movement of the wheelchair. This method will allow most of the people to navigate the wheelchair by themselves.
